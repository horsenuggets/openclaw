# `openclaw directory`

Directory lookups for channels that support it (contacts/peers, groups, and "me").

## Common flags

- `--channel <name>`: channel id/alias (required when multiple channels are configured;
  auto when only one is configured)
- `--account <id>`: account id (default: channel default)
- `--json`: output JSON

## Notes

- `directory` is meant to help you find IDs you can paste into other commands (especially
  `openclaw message send --target ...`).
- For many channels, results are config-backed (allowlists / configured groups) rather
  than a live provider directory.
- Default output is `id` (and sometimes `name`) separated by a tab; use `--json` for
  scripting.

## Using results with `message send`

```bash
openclaw directory peers list --channel slack --query "U0"
openclaw message send --channel slack --target user:U012ABCDEF --message "hello"
```

## ID formats (by channel)

- WhatsApp: `+15551234567` (DM), `1234567890-1234567890@g.us` (group)
- Telegram: `@username` or numeric chat id; groups are numeric ids
- Slack: `user:U…` and `channel:C…`
- Discord: `user:<id>` and `channel:<id>`
